<h1>Project on Console</h1>
<p>Visual Studio is a very useful platform where you can create awesome 
websites and webpages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript better known as 
JS. The best thing about Visual Studio is that you can code here even
when you don't have internet access. So you can create amazing things
even when you are offline!</p>
<p>A console is an operating system window through which a user can 
communicate with the operating system or we can say a console is an 
application in which we can give text as an input from the keyboard and
get the text as an output from the computer. A console traditionally 
refers to a computer terminal where a user may input commands and view 
output such as the results of inputted commands or status messages from 
the computer. The console is often connected to a remote computer or 
computer system that is controlled from the console.
